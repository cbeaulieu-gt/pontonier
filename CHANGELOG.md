# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. The format
is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

This file is decision history, not current policy. Rules that still bind live in
[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) and the documents it links.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `pontonier.core.wslpath`: translate Windows-shaped linked-worktree `gitdir:`
  pointers (`I:/apps/.../.git/worktrees/<name>`) to their WSL2 mount form
  (`/mnt/i/apps/.../.git/worktrees/<name>`) so git running under WSL2 can
  resolve a worktree a native-Windows client created. `normalize_wsl_drive_path`
  is the pure string translation; `linked_worktree_gitdir` reads a `.git`
  pointer file; `git_dir_override` walks up from a cwd to the first `.git`
  marker and returns the `GIT_DIR`/`GIT_WORK_TREE` overrides for the
  Windows-shaped case, `{}` otherwise. Ported from `codex-in-claude`'s WSL2
  fix (`codex-in-claude#13`).
- `pontonier.core.workspace.normalize_wsl_drive_path`: translate a decoded
  `file:///I:/...` MCP root URI (`/I:/ai/claude/x`) to its WSL2 mount form
  (`/mnt/i/ai/claude/x`) before `resolve_workspace` validates an explicit
  `workspace_root`. A different function from
  `pontonier.core.wslpath.normalize_wsl_drive_path` — this one requires a
  leading slash and targets a decoded MCP root URI, not a raw `gitdir:`
  pointer body; the two are not duplicates. Also ported from
  `codex-in-claude#13`.

## [0.6.0] — 2026-08-20

### Added

- `redaction.sanitize_echo` and `redaction.sanitize_echo_prose`: sanitize foreign text
  bound for an error envelope by deleting every Unicode `Cc` code point *before*
  redacting it. Bridges echo subprocess stderr, config keys, and paths into agent-visible
  errors, where an escape sequence can recolor, reposition, or erase — and where a
  control character wedged into a secret defeats the redactor's patterns outright, so the
  value rides out as plaintext. The order is fixed inside the functions and is not a
  caller's to choose: redacting first leaves the split value untouched, and stripping
  afterwards then reassembles the contiguous secret in the outgoing text. `sanitize_echo`
  is for a single-token span (a config key, a path, a rejected flag name);
  `sanitize_echo_prose` is for a multi-line diagnostic and keeps line feeds only when
  removing them yields exactly the fully collapsed view — so the returned text can never
  show anything collapsing would have hidden. In practice newlines survive in a
  diagnostic the redactor did not touch across a line boundary; once a redaction meets a
  boundary the text collapses, deliberately. Neither truncates — callers disagree about
  both the bound and the direction, so each applies its own, after the call.

  Stripping never discloses more than not stripping. One case would have: deleting a
  control character out of a damaged `-----END … PRIVATE KEY-----` marker terminates a
  block that was failing closed, uncovering everything its blanket redaction covered —
  reachable on purpose by an attacker cancelling a blanket that was protecting someone
  else's secret further down. Both helpers restore the unstripped text's coverage in that
  case. The reverse (a repaired `BEGIN` marker, which redacts more) is left alone.
- `worktree.sanitize_echo_prose`: the same stripping ahead of `sanitize_prose`'s alias
  staging. A control character defeats relativization for the same reason it defeats
  redaction — alias matching is an exact string match — so a corrupted worktree path
  would otherwise ride out into an envelope after the worktree is gone. Stripping the
  *output* of `sanitize_prose` cannot fix that: by then the miss has already happened.

  WHERE the strip goes is the subtle part, and both ends are wrong. Stripping *before* the
  staging destroys alias matching from the other side: `_replace_aliases` needs a delimiter
  beside an alias, and a control character is often the delimiter it has — line feed, tab,
  and carriage return all behave this way, so `"prefix\t<root>/f.py"` came back with the
  absolute path intact. So the strip runs in the one window where neither failure is
  reachable: after staging (aliases sit behind alphanumeric placeholders that deleting
  characters cannot damage) and before redaction. Staging then runs a second time on the
  transformed text, because the two passes catch different aliases and the result is their
  union — the first sees the delimiters the strip is about to delete, the second sees a
  path the strip *repaired*. `sanitize_prose` itself is unchanged: one staging pass, no
  transform, byte-identical.

### Changed

- `redaction.exc_summary` routes its detail through `sanitize_echo_prose` rather than
  bare `redact_text`. Exception text reaching an envelope is echoed foreign text under
  the same rule as any other diagnostic. **Bridges: this changes the content of every
  `exc_summary`-derived error message whose exception text carries a control character** —
  judge your own fingerprint and breaking status by your own repository's rules.

### Repository

- `AGENTS.md` gains a **Bridge intake** section: what this library accepts from a
  consuming bridge, and what stays in the bridge. It states the intake criterion, that
  bridge policy stays downstream, that a mixed change lands in two repositories, that a
  fix a bridge waits for needs a release and not just a merge, that a change to a value
  bridges expose is recorded here so each bridge can judge it, and where each half of a
  change is tested. Previously only the downstream half of that decision was written
  down, in `codex-in-claude`'s `AGENTS.md`; a bridge could read "send it upstream" with
  nothing saying what upstream accepts. The two sections link to each other instead of
  restating each other.
- The repository now carries an instruction layer: `AGENTS.md` (canonical norms,
  with `CLAUDE.md` pointing at it), `CONTRIBUTING.md` (setup, the gate, commit
  format), `docs/releasing.md`, and `docs/github-config.md` for the enforced
  controls. Previously an agent had to infer all of it from CI YAML and git history.
- `scripts/check.sh` is the one verification entry point. `.github/workflows/test.yml`
  runs that exact script, so a green local run is a green CI run — the README used to
  document four of the eight checks CI actually ran. Its wheel step builds into a
  temporary directory instead of globbing a persistent `dist/`, which could not be
  reproduced locally once `dist/` held more than one wheel.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` gains a `gate` job: one stable required-check context
  that aggregates the test matrix, so adding a Python version cannot silently narrow
  branch protection.
- The commit-message checker is wired up (`.pre-commit-config.yaml`, installed with
  `prek install --hook-type commit-msg`). Its docstring pointed at a `prek.toml` and a
  `CONTRIBUTING.md` that did not exist, and its allowed scopes were transplanted from
  another repository; both now match this one.
- Two comments that stated the opposite of current policy are corrected: the
  `pyproject.toml` note promising a pydantic dependency that was deliberately never
  added, and the `tests/test_conformance_fakes.py` docstring calling the backend
  protocol PROVISIONAL with a freeze gate still ahead of it.
- Read-only CI jobs no longer keep the checkout token while running repository code
  (`persist-credentials: false`); only the tag-pushing job keeps it.
- Added `CODEOWNERS`, issue and PR templates, `SECURITY.md`, and Dependabot for
  Actions and uv.
- `publish.yml` no longer triggers on a pushed `v*.*.*` tag; `workflow_dispatch` is
  the only entry point. The agent identity necessarily holds `contents: write` (it
  cannot push a branch otherwise), which makes creating a tag reachable by an agent,
  while dispatching needs `actions: write`, which it does not hold. Removing the
  trigger also removed the conditional job guards that existed solely to reconcile the
  two paths, so `create-tag` now always runs and the downstream jobs use plain
  `needs:` success semantics.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-08-16

### Release engineering

- The project is renamed **pontifex → pontonier**. The old name collided with
  the unrelated `pontifex-mcp` on PyPI, which is also MCP-adjacent. A pontonier
  is the engineer who builds pontoon bridges, which keeps the "not a bridge —
  what bridges are built from" framing. Nothing was ever published under the old
  name, so there is no compatibility shim and no deprecation period. Two
  runtime-visible strings moved with it: throwaway worktrees are now
  `pontonier-worktree-*`, and the default worktree git identity is
  `pontonier <pontonier@local>`. All three bridges override both, so neither
  string reaches a consumer.
- `pyproject.toml` is now the single source for the version. `__version__` reads
  the installed distribution metadata instead of repeating a literal, so the two
  can no longer disagree — the drift this replaces was real (`__version__` stuck
  at 0.3.0.dev0 across two bumps). `tests/test_version.py` now pins the
  installed metadata to the `pyproject.toml` declaration, which also catches an
  editable install left stale by a bump without a re-sync.
- Releases publish from CI. `.github/workflows/publish.yml` runs the full test
  gate, builds with `--no-sources`, creates the tag before publishing so a PyPI
  release can never exist without its git tag, uploads to PyPI through trusted
  publishing (OIDC, no long-lived token), and opens a GitHub Release with the
  changelog section as its notes. Adapted from the codex-in-claude workflow.

### Hardening

- `JobStore` now confines job ids to the shape it mints (`uuid4().hex`, 32
  lowercase hex). A job id is used verbatim as a path component under the
  workspace directory; previously a caller-supplied traversal-shaped id
  (`../…`) reached the filesystem join, and `status`/`discard`/`cancel` could
  read — or delete — a record-shaped directory outside the store root.
  Defense in depth: two of the three bridges pass `job_id: str` to the store
  unvalidated. Malformed ids now read as not-found in every public lookup
  (`status`, `result_payload`, `discard`, `cancel` — no wire-behavior change
  for consumers), and the `_job_dir` join itself raises as a backstop.
  Perturbation-verified: with the guards disabled, the new traversal test
  reaches a planted decoy record outside the store root.

### 0.5.0 (THE PROTOCOL FREEZE — `contract_api_version = 1`)

- `pontonier.backend` is FROZEN. The plan's freeze criterion — all three real
  adapters compile, type-check, and pass conformance and differential fixtures
  — was met and then exceeded: each bridge's production orchestration now
  stages every model-bearing run through its adapter's `prepare()`
  (codex-in-claude's `run_codex_exec`, moonbridge's `run_kimi_exec`, and
  claude-in-codex's sync tools + async job launch), so the adapters cannot
  drift from production behavior — they are production behavior.
- Freeze discipline, now binding: required Protocol members and required
  `BackendContract` fields are stable within a minor line; "additive" changes
  to a Protocol or frozen dataclass are breaking, so new behavior lands as
  defaulted fields or optional capability protocols (the pattern
  `effort_validation`, `dropped_flags`, and `artifact_paths` already
  followed).
- Deferred-findings ledger closed: the 0.3.0 note's schema-instruction seam
  resolved consumer-side (the Kimi re-plumb dissolved the duplication — one
  source, in the bridge that owns the strategy); classification's ambient
  extra-args context is recorded on the Codex adapter as acceptable while
  extra args are operator-owned process state.

### 0.4.0 (redaction strengthening — key-block handling flows into core)

- `PreparedRun.artifact_paths` (defaulted, non-breaking): NAMED staged paths,
  keyed like `RunOutcome.artifact_texts`. Freeze-window finding from the Kimi
  adapter: the flat `artifacts` tuple cannot tell the consumer which staged
  file is the answer channel, and it must be read back inside the `prepare()`
  context (staging is torn down on exit). `artifacts` stays as the
  cleanup/enumeration view; when both are set they must agree.
- `PreparedRun.dropped_flags` (defaulted, non-breaking): the channel for
  help-gated flags the preparation dropped because the installed CLI does not
  advertise them. Freeze-window finding from re-plumbing the Codex bridge's
  orchestration through its adapter: production surfaces dropped flags as
  compat warnings and reconciles reported model provenance from them, so a
  `prepare()` that discarded them could not carry the real hot path.

- `core.redaction` now redacts multi-line private-key blocks (PEM/PKCS8/OpenSSH/
  PGP) STATEFULLY — ported from the claude-in-codex bridge's local redactor,
  closing the pre-unification gap recorded under 0.3.0. The BEGIN/END markers
  stay visible so a reviewer sees what was dropped; every body line between them
  is replaced 1:1 with `[redacted: secret value]` (hunk line counts survive, so
  a redacted patch still applies); an UNTERMINATED block fails closed, redacted
  to end of input; a block never bleeds across `diff --git` headers or
  hunk/metadata boundaries; and the inline patterns scan the key pass's output,
  so a token sharing the END marker's physical line is still caught. Applies to
  `redact`/`DiffRedactor` (key masks flow through the same staged
  `masked_paths`/`inline_masks` accounting, including withhold dominance) and to
  `redact_text`/`redact_tree`/`exc_summary`.
- Five vendor patterns ported from the claude-in-codex bridge's local set:
  GitHub fine-grained PAT (`github_pat_`), GitLab PAT (`glpat-`), Anthropic
  key (`sk-ant-` — its hyphens put it out of the plain `sk-` run's reach, so
  it is not a redundant specialization), npm automation token (`npm_`), and
  PyPI upload token (`pypi-`). Unifying that bridge onto this engine without
  them would have weakened its coverage; codex-in-claude and moonbridge gain
  them outright.
- `StreamRedactor` — a stateful line-stream redactor for callers that sanitize
  output as it is produced (a worker scrubbing a child's stderr) and cannot
  buffer the full sensitive stream: key-block state spans calls, and the
  public writable `in_key_block` lets a caller that lost line fidelity
  (overlong-line truncation) fail closed until an END marker arrives.
- REMOVED the `-----BEGIN [A-Z ]*PRIVATE KEY-----` entry from
  `SECRET_VALUE_PATTERNS`. It masked the BEGIN marker itself while shipping the
  entire base64 body — a disclosure marker claiming coverage it did not have —
  and its missing trailing alternation never matched PGP's "PRIVATE KEY BLOCK"
  suffix at all. The stateful pass owns key material now; output for
  key-bearing input changes accordingly (markers visible, body dropped).

### 0.3.0 (protocol feedback from the three real adapters — still PROVISIONAL)

- `RunOutcome.events` is now an OPAQUE raw payload string instead of parsed
  event dicts. The Codex adapter showed that typed dicts forced eager parsing
  upstream of the tolerance boundary — real normalize layers must parse
  tolerantly so a malformed line degrades instead of raising. Its docs also now
  state that a backend may use neither the events nor the artifacts channel
  (the Claude adapter reads everything from the stdout envelope).
- `BackendContract.effort_validation` (defaulted, non-breaking) declares how
  pre-spend effort validation works: `enumerated` (Claude),
  `token_floor_plus_catalog` (Kimi — universal token floor, catalog-relative
  refinement, failing OPEN when the catalog cannot answer), or `shape_only`
  (Codex — upstream rejects bad values loudly; only argv-hostile shapes are
  refused locally).
- Deferred to the freeze window, recorded from adapter findings: a shared seam
  for the prompt-append schema-instruction text (currently duplicated in the
  Kimi bridge under a byte-parity test), and classification's ambient
  extra-args context.
- `JobStore.start` (and `start_idempotent` via passthrough) accepts
  `stdin_text`: streamed to the worker over a pipe by a daemon thread, never
  persisted — the transport for bridges whose prompts must stay off disk and
  off argv (the claude bridge's design). Default `None` keeps the prior
  DEVNULL behavior byte-identical.
- Known gap, discovered during the claude-in-codex context comparison:
  `core.redaction` has NO multi-line PEM/OpenSSH/PGP key-block handling — a
  private key pasted into a tracked file's diff (or returned in prose) is
  scrubbed only if the inline value patterns happen to match. claude-in-codex's
  local redactor handles these blocks statefully (failing closed on an
  unterminated block); that handling must flow into `core.redaction` BEFORE any
  bridge unifies onto the shared engine, or unification would weaken redaction.

### 0.2.0 (milestone M1 — conventions + provisional protocol)

- `pontonier.conventions.envelope`: shared error taxonomy — universal codes
  (the verified intersection across the three bridges), backend-prefixed code
  minting, feature-gated codes (`transfer`, `model_validation`,
  `empty_response_detection`), and per-code `RepairRule` tables parameterized
  by a `BackendErrorVocabulary`. Wire serialization deliberately stays
  consumer-side.
- `pontonier.conventions.prompts`: the shared framing/builders, with the host
  harness name as a parameter; `framings("Claude Code")` reproduces the
  source bridges' prose byte-for-byte (pinned by tests).
- `pontonier.conventions.annotations`: tool-annotation builders parameterized
  by declared effects (`AnnotationEffects`) instead of universal constants —
  the bridges' differing values are deliberate positions, now explicit.
- `pontonier.conventions.preflight`: `HelpProbe` (instance-cached `--help`
  feature detection, fail-open) generalizing the per-repo module.
- `pontonier.conventions.fingerprint`: the surface-digest / fingerprint-bump
  invariant as reusable, framework-agnostic mechanics.
- `pontonier.backend` (**PROVISIONAL**, `CONTRACT_API_VERSION = 0`):
  `BackendContract` (static facts: flag classes, failure-signature tables,
  field-scoped model-catalog authority, typed extra-args policy, isolation
  policy, limits), the `AgentBackend` protocol as a staged lifecycle
  (`validate_request` → `prepare` → `finalize`/`classify_failure`), shared
  `RunRequest`/`PreparedRun`/`RunOutcome`/`ExecResult` types, and a shared
  failure classifier with fixed precedence and a backend hook.
- `pontonier.testing`: importable, framework-agnostic test kit —
  surface-honesty phrase scanning, adapter/contract conformance checks
  (including the mandatory pre-spend effort-validation invariant), and
  sync/async pair parity. No pytest dependency.
- Three fake adapters (Codex-like, Kimi-like, Claude-like) validate that the
  provisional protocol expresses all three real invocation shapes.
- Deviation from plan, documented: no `pydantic` dependency was added — the
  backend/conventions layers are plain dataclasses, so the wheel still
  depends only on `anyio`. The planned `testing` extra is unnecessary for the
  same reason (the kit imports no test framework).

### 0.1.0 (milestone M0 — core extraction)

- `pontonier.core`: the CLI-agnostic machinery extracted from moonbridge's
  `_core` (jobs, worktree, gitdiff, redaction, runtime, gitproc, streamcap,
  idempotency, workspace, jsoncache), carrying the redaction
  trailing-newline fix and the orphan-process sweep.
- `WorktreeConfig`: worktree prefix, baseline-commit identity, and extra
  exclude pathspecs are per-consumer fields with behavioral tests.
- One-way dependency rule (`core` imports nothing from the rest) enforced by
  import-linter in CI.
