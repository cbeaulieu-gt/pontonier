    consumes the stream record-by-record (never a whole capture), because ``--numstat``
    emits one record per changed file and is therefore unbounded in the workspace's
    changed-file count (#331, #350).

    Format notes, all load-bearing:

    * Records are newline-delimited, NOT ``-z``: a rename keeps its whole ``old => new``
      pathname inside the third field, so the split still yields exactly three fields.
      (``-z`` would restructure a rename into several NUL-separated fields.)
    * ``-`` stands in for either count on a binary file: it is one changed *file* with no
      line tally, so it is counted in ``files`` and left out of the line totals.
    * A record whose split is not three fields is skipped rather than fatal — the
      pre-existing posture of both parsers this replaced.
    * A record the bounded reader truncated mid-pathname still counts exactly: both numeric
      columns and both tabs precede the pathname. Counting it beats failing loudly (the
      arithmetic is recoverable) and beats sniffing the truncation marker (which would
      false-positive a real pathname containing that text).
    * The trailing separator, when present, lands on the *pathname* field — never on a
      numeric column — so the final record of output that does not end in a newline counts
      like any other. It is stripped anyway, to keep the parsed pathname clean for any
      future field this consumer grows.

# ignore the child would honor (#330 review). Deliberately omitted:
#   * repo-discovery vars (GIT_DIR, GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES, GIT_DISCOVERY_ACROSS_FILESYSTEM,

    globally-ignored file (e.g. one listed in ``~/.config/git/ignore``) as untracked and
    — with ``untracked="include"`` — send its contents to the agent.

    The effective path is resolved from the SERVER's own environment, which has HOME/XDG,
    mirroring git's own resolution:

    * If ``core.excludesFile`` is SET in the merged config (system+global+local, at git's
      own precedence via ``git config``), its value is used verbatim — even if the file is
      empty, missing, or a directory — because an explicit setting SUPPRESSES the default
      location in git's semantics (``-c core.excludesFile=/missing`` disables global
      ignores rather than falling back). Reading the repo-local layer here honors
      local-over-global precedence, so this never overrides a repo-local setting.
    * If UNSET, the default location (:func:`_default_excludes_path`) is used, even if
      absent (git no-ops on a missing excludes file). If no default is computable, no flag
      is emitted (the child then has no global layer, matching git under the same env).

    The resolver runs under :func:`_resolver_env` (the child's stripped env plus only the
    global-config source vars), anchored to ``cwd``, so it discovers the same repo and reads
    the same system+local config the child does — adding only the global layer. ``--path``
    expands a leading ``~``. A relative value is passed through UNCHANGED: git resolves a
    relative ``core.excludesFile`` against the process cwd, and the enumeration child runs
    with the SAME ``cwd``, so the relative form resolves identically (joining it onto ``cwd``
    here would double-prefix under a relative ``cwd``).

    ``-z`` NUL-terminates the value so an excludesFile path containing a newline is
    preserved intact (a plain ``--get`` would let a multi-line value be truncated to its
    first line, pointing at the wrong ignore file). The value is read through
    :func:`gitproc.run_lines` — the shared watchdog/concurrent-stderr-drain runner — so a
    stalled or verbose child is killed at ``timeout`` and never deadlocks, and memory stays
    bounded. Merged config includes the untrusted repo-local layer, so accumulation stops
    and fails closed once the value's UTF-8 length exceeds :data:`_EXCLUDES_VALUE_MAX`,
    rather than materializing an arbitrarily large value and interpolating it into the next

    """Build new-file patches for the untracked files among ``norm_paths`` and feed
    them into ``acc``.

    Returns ``(files, added_lines)``. ``git ls-files --others --exclude-standard``
    enumerates untracked files under the named paths while skipping gitignored ones;
    the injected ``-c core.excludesFile`` re-supplies the user's global ignore layer the
    HOME-stripped env would otherwise drop, so the set matches `git add`'s default (#330)
    and a globally-ignored file is never gathered and sent. An explicitly-named new file
    is thus reviewed instead of silently producing an empty review (#74). Untracked files
    can never appear in ``git diff HEAD``, so there is no double-counting with the tracked
    diff.

    The patches are produced by ``git`` itself: each discovered path's content is
    hashed into a blob and recorded in a throwaway index (``GIT_INDEX_FILE``, never the
    repo's real index/working tree), which is then streamed through
    ``_stream_redacted_diff`` into ``acc`` — so the diff is never materialised whole
    in memory (F1b). Letting git format the patch — rather than hand-rolling it —
    gets correct handling of symlinks (``mode 120000``), binary files,
    control-character path quoting, and line counts (via ``--numstat``) for free.

    Blobs are created with ``hash-object --no-filters`` and entries with
    ``update-index --cacheinfo`` (not ``git add``) so configured gitattributes clean
    filters and EOL normalization never run: gathering stays side-effect-free of repo
    config and the reviewer sees the raw working-tree bytes, matching the deliberate
    ``--no-ext-diff``/``--no-textconv`` posture elsewhere here.

    Object writes are redirected to a temp object dir (``GIT_OBJECT_DIRECTORY``), with
    the repo's real objects as a read-only alternate, so the raw (pre-redaction) bytes
    of an untracked secret never persist as a blob in the repo's own ``.git/objects``.
    The temp index and objects are discarded with the tempdir, leaving no trace.

    Both cardinality-driven git outputs are streamed, never captured whole (#331): the
    ``ls-files -z`` listing is fed record-by-record into the per-path index build (single
    enumeration — no second count that could disagree under concurrent mutation, #322 F3),
    and ``--numstat`` is summed through the same bounded reader. Memory stays O(one record +
    chunk) regardless of how many untracked files the workspace has. The whole composed
    listing-plus-index-build phase is bounded by one absolute ``deadline``: each per-path
    ``git`` child gets only the remaining time, and a consumer raise mid-stream reaps the
    ``ls-files`` producer, so the phase cannot run past ``timeout`` even though the producer's
    own watchdog only bounds the producer."""

    like :func:`count_untracked`), folding each NUL record into a digest. Scoped and
    configured to MATCH the gathered diff so the token moves for exactly the changes a review
    covers, no more:

    - ``--untracked-files=all`` — plain status collapses an untracked *directory* to one
      entry, but the untracked enumeration (``ls-files --others``) lists every file; ``all``
      keeps the two consistent and also overrides a hostile ``status.showUntrackedFiles=no``.
    - the same normalized ``paths`` pathspec — an out-of-scope edit must not trip detection.
    - the same global-``excludes`` layer the enumeration uses — a globally-ignored scratch
      file must not trip it either.
    - ``--no-optional-locks`` + the shared ``core.fsmonitor=false`` hardening — status must
      not write the index or run a repo-configured fsmonitor in this process.

    This is a CLASSIFICATION fingerprint, not a content hash. It is a best-effort signal that
    the working tree was *modified during the gather*, not a proof of diff inconsistency: it
    trips on file additions/removals and porcelain status changes (including a concurrent
    ``git add`` that does not alter the reviewed ``git diff HEAD`` patch, and an edit that
    lands anywhere in the bracketed window — both are real concurrent modifications, disclosed
    conservatively). It does NOT trip on a content-only re-edit of an already-modified file or
    an A->B->A round trip between the two captures, so its ABSENCE is not proof the tree held
    still. A staging-insensitive token (``git diff HEAD --name-status`` plus a separate
    untracked scan) or a retry-to-stabilize loop would narrow the conservative cases, but both
