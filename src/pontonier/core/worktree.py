"""Run an agent's writes inside a throwaway git worktree, then capture the diff.

This is the engine of the `propose` tier: the agent edits files in an isolated
worktree (never the live tree), and we return the resulting patch for review. The
worktree mirrors the live tree's *tracked* state (HEAD + uncommitted tracked
changes as a baseline commit) so the agent builds on current code; the returned
diff is exactly the agent's changes on top of that baseline. CLI-agnostic.

Repo-config isolation: these porcelain git ops run in the *server process*, not in
the agent's sandbox, so every invocation is prefixed with ``_hardening_flags`` (see
there), which disables repo-configured hooks, fsmonitor, and every gitattributes
``clean``/``smudge``/``process`` filter driver; the baseline commit also passes
``--no-gpg-sign``. That closes the repo-controlled code-execution surface across the
worktree lifecycle (checkout, staging, and working-tree diffs)."""

    The worktree is torn down before the caller reads a delegate result, so every

    replaced by a single ``.``, which leaves the rest of the path to follow on its own:
    ``<root>/src/f.py`` -> ``./src/f.py``, ``file://<root>/f.py`` -> ``./f.py``, and a
    bare ``<root>`` -> ``.``.

    The paths stay RELATIVE rather than being re-rooted at the live repo: the diff is not
    applied, so a live absolute path would be equally dead for a new file and, worse,
    would point at a real file whose content differs from what the agent described.

    The ``./`` prefix is load-bearing, not cosmetic: bare-relative output would turn
    ``[x](<root>/javascript:a)`` into a link target with a live URI scheme, and stripping
    only the root from a ``file://`` URI would leave ``file://./f.py``, where ``.`` parses
    as the HOST. Prefixing sidesteps both without teaching this function to parse Markdown.

    A match needs prose punctuation (or a string edge) on both sides — see ``_LEFT_DELIMS``
    / ``_RIGHT_DELIMS`` for why that is an allowlist rather than a denylist of path
    characters, and why ``/`` is allowed on only one side.

    A sentence-final bare root (``... in <root>.``) is a special case: replacing it with a
    bare ``.`` would emit ``..``, the parent directory, more misleading than the dead path
    it replaced — so this one shape gets ``_AMBIGUOUS_SUFFIX_MARKER`` (``[worktree]``)
    instead of ``.``, never a fragment of the original path either way.

    Aliases are sorted longest-first HERE rather than trusting the caller's order: with a

    the wrong file. Blank entries are dropped — an empty alias matches everywhere.

#    never stop part-way through and leave a fragment.
# 2. It is comfortably longer than the labelled pattern's 16-character minimum, so a
#    labelled path still reads as a long value and stays redacted no matter how short the
#    real root is (erring toward redaction).
# 3. It is ABSENT from the text being sanitized, verified rather than assumed. A fixed
#    sentinel let model output smuggle a covered secret straight through: the final

#    in secret shapes. `eyJ<8 chars><sentinel><8 chars><sentinel><8 chars>` carries no dots

    """Relativize worktree paths AND redact secrets — the one order safe for both (#412).

    Doing these in sequence is not safe in either direction, which is why they are one
    function rather than two calls a caller has to order correctly:

    - **Relativize, then redact** shortens a labelled worktree-prefixed value below the
      redactor's 16-character floor, so ``api_key=<root>/abcdefgh`` becomes
      ``api_key=./abcdefgh`` and the secret escapes. The agent sees the worktree path, so an
      injected task can aim for that shape deliberately.
    - **Redact, then relativize** lets the redactor consume PART of an alias. Its value
      class covers ``=`` but stops at ``:``, so a crafted
      ``api_key=<16 chars>=file://<root>/abcdefgh`` has ``...=file`` eaten, leaving
      ``://<root>/abcdefgh`` — whose bare root is now preceded by ``/`` and so fails the
      left-hand delimiter check. Both the dead path and the secret survive.

    So each alias is first staged behind a token from ``_staged_placeholder`` — which the
    redactor can neither partially consume nor confuse with pre-existing text (see there for
    all three required properties); redaction runs against that; then any token that survived
    — i.e. was not part of a redacted secret — becomes ``.``. The sentence-final ambiguous
    case (see ``_replace_aliases``) is staged behind a SEPARATE token
    (``_staged_ambiguous_placeholder``) with the same properties, so it carries the same
    redaction guarantee; a survivor there becomes ``_AMBIGUOUS_SUFFIX_MARKER`` instead of
    ``.`` — never the bracketed marker directly, which would break the labelled-value run
    the redactor needs to see (#420 review round 4).

    Redaction remains best-effort by contract (see ``redaction``): an adversarial model can
    always emit an unlabelled secret that no pattern matches. This closes the interaction
    between the two passes, not that broader gap."""

    ``transform`` runs after alias staging and before redaction — the only window where a
    text rewrite can neither break alias matching nor be undone by it. Aliases are already
    behind alphanumeric placeholders, so a transform that deletes characters cannot damage
    them; and the transform still runs ahead of the redactor, which is where control-
    character stripping has to be (see ``redaction.sanitize_echo``).

    Staging runs AGAIN after the transform, against the same placeholders. The two passes
    catch different aliases and the result is their union: the first sees the delimiters
    the transform is about to delete, the second sees an alias the transform REPAIRED — a
    path that carried a control character inside it matches nothing until the character is
    gone. Running only one of them loses whichever set the other covers, and both sets are
    real. The second pass cannot disturb the first's work, since a placeholder is not an
    alias.

    """:func:`sanitize_prose` for text bound for an ERROR envelope: control characters are
    deleted between the alias staging and the redaction.

    Use this instead of :func:`sanitize_prose` wherever the text is a diagnostic being
    echoed back to a caller. A control character defeats BOTH passes this function
    composes, and for the same reason: each is a match over contiguous text. The redaction
    half is documented on ``redaction.sanitize_echo``. The relativization half is the
    mirror image — alias matching is an exact string match, so ``\\x1b`` wedged into the
    printed worktree path means no alias matches and the dead absolute path rides out
    whole.

    Stripping the OUTPUT of :func:`sanitize_prose` does not fix either half: by then both
    misses have already happened, and removing the control character merely produces a
    clean-looking message that still carries the path and the secret.

    WHERE the strip goes is the subtle part, and BOTH ends are wrong. Stripping before the
    staging destroys alias matching from the other side: ``_replace_aliases`` needs a
    delimiter beside an alias, and a control character is often the delimiter it has —
    ``"prefix\\t<root>/f.py"`` relativizes correctly until the tab is deleted, after which
    the alias inherits ``x`` on its left, stops matching, and the dead absolute path is
    disclosed. Line feed, tab, and carriage return all behave this way. So the strip runs
    in the one window where neither failure is reachable: AFTER staging (aliases are behind
    alphanumeric placeholders that deleting characters cannot damage) and BEFORE redaction
    (where the strip has to be). See :func:`_sanitize_prose`.

    That window is also why this helper can share ``redaction.sanitize_echo_prose``'s
    newline policy rather than needing one of its own: with aliases already staged,
    collapsing line feeds can no longer cost a relativization.

    ``aliases`` are the real worktree paths and so contain no control characters (this
    library creates them under a temp root it names itself), so they are matched as given.

    The key-block guard applies here for the same reason it applies to
    ``redaction.sanitize_echo``: a control character damaging an END marker makes a block
    look unterminated, so deleting it would terminate the block and uncover everything the
    fail-closed blanket covered."""
